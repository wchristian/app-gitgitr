This is something you probably\r\nonly really need if you're obsessive about running the most recent\r\nversion of git, or if you maintain something like [Git::Wrapper](https://metacpan.org/pod/Git::Wrapper),\r\nwhere the ability to quickly install a particular git version comes up\r\nway more often that you would like.\r\n\r\n# OPTIONS\r\n\r\n- --help / -h\r\n\r\n    Displays basically the same information you're currently soaking in.\r\n\r\n- --no\\_symlink / -N\r\n\r\n    Don't symlink /opt/git to the new build directory    \r\n\r\n- --prefix / -p\r\n\r\n    Installation prefix for the current build. Defaults to\r\n    /opt/git-$GIT\\_VERSION\\_NUMBER\r\n\r\n- --reinstall / -r\r\n\r\n    By default, `gitgitr` will not build a version that's already\r\n    installed. This flag will force it to build a version even if it is\r\n    already preset.\r\n\r\n- --run\\_tests / -t\r\n\r\n    Makes `gitgitr` run the git test suite after building and before\r\n    installing. If the test suite fails, the build will not be\r\n    installed. Disabled by default because the test suite takes a really\r\n    long time to run.\r\n\r\n- --verbose / -V\r\n\r\n    Makes `gitgitr` be a lot more chatty about what it's doing\r\n\r\n- --version / -v\r\n\r\n    Specifies what version of git to build. Defaults to the most recent\r\n    version as found on the front page of [http://git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com)\r\n\r\n# AUTHOR\r\n\r\nJohn SJ Anderson <genehack@genehack.org>\r\n\r\n# COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis software is copyright (c) 2014 by John SJ Anderson.\r\n\r\nThis is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe same terms as the Perl 5 programming language system itself.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
